# PyFile
To run the application, you'll need to have Python installed onto your computer
After, navigate to treemap_visualiser.py and scroll all the way down to the function call "run_treemap_file_system".
Inside the function, copy and paste a directory path inside the quotes
Run the same file and voila!

## How to understand and use the application
Now all you'll see are bright blocks of different sizes and colours. The bigger it is, the more space it occupies.
If you click on the block, you can see what it is on the bottom left and how much space it takes up on your computer.

*  Clicking on a block and pressing the 'up' arrow key increases the display file size relative to the other files in its particular directory 
(only visually, not the actual file size)
*  Clicking on a block and pressing the 'down' arrow key decreases the display file size relative to the other files in its particular directory 
(only visually, not the actual file size)
*  Clicking on a block and pressing the 'E' key expands the block if its a directory and shows its inner files. If done on a file, has no effect
*  Clicking on a block and pressing the 'A' key expands every directory in the path and shows all inner files. 
*  Clicking on a block and pressing the 'C' key collapses the block and makes it into a directory, if it is possible
*  Clicking on a block and pressing the 'X' key collapses all blocks show and reduces everything to a directory if it is possible
